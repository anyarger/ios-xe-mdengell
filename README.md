This is a repo of sample function calls. Most of the code is auto-generated, so forgive lack of comments. All of the function calls do the same thing --> Admin down a single interface on an ISR via a PATCH verb in REST. There are native, openconfig, and ietf examples in several different language consutrcts. Please note the filename as a decodoer ring.
